# impulse
Impulse is a platform that mitigates impulsive spending and brings consciousness to consumerism.

**Mission:** Lorem Ipsum.

**The Idea:** Online one-click purchases often lead to buyers making impulse purchases that are
unnecessary or that they may later regret. Our goal is to protect buyers and allow them to see how
much they can save with conscious spending. We also give users the ability to compare their justifications
for purchasing a product against how they feel about the purchase present day. We aim to decrease mindless
spending for a more fiscally responsible life.
