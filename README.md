***Mission*** 

Bring Consciousness To Consumerism.

___

***The Idea***

Online one-click purchases often lead to buyers making impulse purchases that are
unnecessary or that they may later regret. Our goal is to protect buyers and allow them to see how
much they can save with conscious spending. We also give users the ability to compare their justifications
for purchasing a product against how they feel about the purchase present day. We aim to decrease mindless
spending for a more fiscally responsible life.

***Components***

- The first thing we had to design was the main website. We need to implement user authentication, user authorization and data analytics. This site would be the central hub of impluse, containg a dashboard that generated analytics for each user based on their activity. This is what it looks like:

- We also had to create a chrome extension that had two main components to it as well. The chrome extension needs a modal that acted as a middleman between the consumer and the ecommerce cite. We wanted to pause the user's activity, and help them really think about what actions they were about to take. We also had to create the chrome extension pop up section that allow a user to login (so their information could be stored and pushed to the database).

This is what the modal looks like:

This is what the extension popup looks like:

***Features***
- Users can create accounts, login to the dashboard and extension, and keep track of their impulse purchases and analytics associated with them
